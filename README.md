Since graduating I have skippered yachts, had my UX designs implemented, worked for a bespoke tailors and been part of a volunteer team managing woodland. These may seem unrelated but have a few key overlaps, and have highlighted to me what I would like from a career. I thrive when I'm able to make a meaningful contribution to a team, apply my analytical approach to problem solving and work in an environment that encourages learning and personal growth. Which has culminated in me pursuing a career in software development.

While at Makers Academy (a highly selective 16 week software development course) I've learnt coding best practices and a detailed view of the development world. I can't wait to implement the skills I've developed and foster them within professional team environment.
