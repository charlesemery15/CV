Since graduating I have skippered yachts, had my UX designs implemented, worked for a bespoke tailors and been part of a volunteer team managing woodland. These may seem unrelated but have a few key overlaps, which have brought to light what kind of working environment I would like to build a career on. I have found, I thrive when I'm able to make a meaningful contribution to a team, apply my analytical approach to problem solving and work in an environment that encourages learning and personal growth. This has led me to pursuing a career in software development.

While at Makers Academy (a highly selective 16 week software development course) I've learnt coding best practices and a detailed view of the development world. I can't wait to implement the skills I've developed and foster them within professional team environment.

## Skills
### Interpersonal Skills
In every roll I've had whether that's Skippering a yacht or blending wine on vineyard. I've managed to quickly create an effective working relationship. While on a week long sail along the english channel I was skippering. I had to manage a crew that found it difficult to work together. We hadn't sailed together before and I didn't have long to get them to work effectively. By rotating the shift systems and really listening to the pain points of each member I was able to not only get the crew to settle their differences but to work effectively together. We knocked a three hours off a ten hour crossing.

### Infectious Enthusiasm
I've never found it hard to get people onside and instil a sense of ownership in a team. While at University I co-founded the cycling society. An opportunity arose where we could offer a bike repair service. I spent time with UCL's union funding committee, bringing them onboard. I was able to facilitate the supply of bikes from Camden council, encourage the creation of new bike lanes and bike supplies for students.  

### Problem Solving
Whenever I'm introduced to new systems, I always question "why?" getting to the root cause of problems is a big part of solving the problem. While I was doing the UX for a start up, the stake holders suggested that their checkout process wasn't working as customers preferred to buy their product on third party sites. I started to video customers just navigating the site unassisted, then asking them to buy the product. This highlighted a few key pain points which indicated that the flow of the checkout process was floored and not that users preferred third party sites. I was able to change a few buttons and text within the flow and back up the changes with prototype testing. This solved the root cause of the problem and disprove the stake holder assumptions.

Working with NIX and KIX a vegan drink start up, I was able to put into practice all principles taught.

Creating Personas from User Research to inform a detailed task analysis. Along with Experience Mapping the site, I was able to draw up informed user stories. Using Wireframming and user flows I lay out the basic functionality and content of the site, ultimately creating a test prototype of the site using Sketch and Marvel. These designs have since been adopted by NIX and KIXs site.
